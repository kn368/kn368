### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Part 2 of the lab was one of my favorites because we worked on implementing the logic for the Blackjack game, which was both engaging and challenging. I enjoyed learning how to structure the game using functions to handle tasks like dealing cards, calculating scores, and determining the winner. This hands-on experience helped me better understand how to use conditional statements and loops to control game flow. It was exciting to see the game come to life through our code and to debug the logic to ensure it worked correctly.

* Lab 7

    This was also one of my favorites because we worked on writing and testing the parking_functions.cc file, which involved creating and implementing functions to solve real-world problems related to parking. Learning how to use modular programming techniques to break the problem into smaller, manageable functions, such as calculating parking costs and validating user input. This lab helped me solidify my understanding of function prototypes, parameter passing, and return values, making the code more organized and efficient. It was rewarding to see how each function contributed to building a complete and functional program.

* Lab 8

    Part 2 of this lab was particularly enjoyable because we worked on creating visual patterns  which made coding feel more artistic and dynamic. I appreciated the challenge of using nested loops to produce intricate designs, as it helped me understand how to structure loops effectively. This exercise also sharpened my problem-solving skills by requiring careful attention to detail to ensure the patterns appeared correctly. Watching the designs take shape through the code was a rewarding experience that showcased the creative side of programming.
